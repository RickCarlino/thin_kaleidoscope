# Thin Kaleidoscope

This is an adaptation to the [Kaleidoscope](https://github.com/JoshSmith/kaleidoscope) gem by [Josh Smith](https://github.com/JoshSmith).

Like the original Kaleidoscope, it is able to do color proximity estimations.

Unlike the original, it does not do anything else. It has 0 runtime dependencies.
